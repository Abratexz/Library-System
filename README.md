**Library System**

Overview
The Library System project is a web-based application designed to manage and streamline library operations. Built with a combination of JavaScript, EJS, HTML, and CSS, the project offers a user-friendly interface for managing books, members, and lending transactions. It also includes SQL scripts to help set up the required database schema.

**Features**
Book and Member Management:
Easily add, update, or delete books and member records.

Lending Transactions:
Manage checkouts and returns to keep track of borrowed books.

Responsive Web Interface:
Uses EJS templating along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a dynamic and responsive user experience.

Database Integration:
Comes with SQL files (e.g., db_library (2).sql and db_library.sql_2.gz) to help you quickly set up the underlying database for storing library records.

Development Tools:
Contains a .vscode folder with Visual Studio Code settings to streamline the development process.

Potential Payment Integration:
The inclusion of a file named stripe.exe hints at possible integration with payment processing (for fines or membership fees), though you may need to review or configure this component further to meet your project requirements.
